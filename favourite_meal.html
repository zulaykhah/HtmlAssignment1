    <h3>My first best food is:</h3>
    <h3>Fried Rice</h3>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; background-color: red; color: white;">About Fried Rice</h3>
    <p>Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South Asian cuisines, as well as a staple national dish of Indonesia. As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations. Fried rice first developed during the Sui Dynasty in China and
       as such all fried rice dishes can trace their origins to Chinese fried rice.
       Many varieties of fried rice have their own specific list of ingredients. 
       In Greater China, common varieties include Yangzhou fried rice and Hokkien fried rice.
       Japanese chāhan is considered a Japanese Chinese dish, having derived from Chinese fried rice dishes. In Southeast Asia, similarly constructed Indonesian, Malaysian, and Singaporean nasi goreng and Thai khao phat are popular dishes. In the West, most restaurants catering to vegetarians have invented their own varieties of fried rice, including egg fried rice. Fried rice is also seen on the menus of American restaurants offering cuisines with no native tradition of the dish. Additionally, the cuisine of some Latin American countries includes variations on fried rice,
       including Ecuadorian chaulafan, Peruvian arroz chaufa, Cuban arroz frito, and 
       Puerto Rican arroz mamposteao.</p>
       <p>How to prepare Friedrice:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice properly, and drain it</li>
        <li>Then stir fry the rice in oil separately</li>
        <li>Stir-fry vegetables moderately add protein, and season</li>
        <li>Then mix both rice and vegetables together and allow to steam</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>My Second best food is:</h3>
    <h3>Yam and Eggs</h3>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; background-color: red;color: white;">About Yam and Egg</h3>
    <p>Boiled yam and fried eggs is a common breakfast choice in Nigerian homes.
       Yam is a popular staple in West African countries which means lots of yam are planted annually to meet this demand. According to the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Nigeria accounted for about 70 percent of the world’s production amounting to 17 million tonnes from land area 2,837,000 hectares under yam cultivation.
       Yams have a distinct brown skin and can be white, yellow, purple, or pink inside depending on the type of yam and maturity.
       Yams are not only an excellent source of fibre but also high in potassium and manganese, which are important for supporting bone health, growth, metabolism, and heart function. This succulent tuber also provides decent amounts of other micronutrients, such as copper and vitamins which makes this Nigerian yam and fried eggs recipe perfect!
    </p>
    <p><b>How to prepare Yam and Eggs</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack 4 eggs in a mixing bowl and garnish with sliced tomatoes, onions and scotch bonnet.</li>
        <li>Add shredded sardines (or corned beef or shrimps), salt and stock cubes
            and mix together with a fork or whisk. 4 eggs are enough for 1 or 2 serves.</li>
        <li>Place a non-stick frying pan on the hob over medium heat and add 3-4 tablespoons of cooking oil. Let the oil heat up for about 2mins before tossing the egg batter in.</li>
        <li>Fry for 3-4mins or until golden brown around the edges. Flip and fry for another 2-3mins.</li>
        <li>Slice yam tuber with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li>Peel yam with a knife.</li>
        <li>Rinse the yam under cold water and toss in a saucepan.</li>
        <li>Add enough water and salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Boil at high-medium heat. Check halfway to ensure that water hasn’t dried out.
            Once yam is cooked, drain out any excess water so the yam doesn’t get too soft and sticky.</li>

    <h3>My third best food is:</h3>
    <p><b>Amala and Ewedu</b></p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center; background-color: red;color: white;">About Amala and Ewedu</h3>
    <p>Àmàlà is a local indigenous Yoruba food, native to the Yoruba ethnic group of Southwestern Nigeria.
       It is made out of yam and/or cassava flour, or unripe plantain flour.
       Tubers of yams are peeled, sliced, cleaned, dried and then blended into flour.
       It is also called èlùbọ́.Yams are white in colour but turn brown when dried which gives àmàlà its colour.
       The particular yam species best for preparing àmàlà is Dioscorea cayenensis (Ikoro) because of its high starch content.
       Yam, the common name for species in the genus Dioscorea, grows in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Oceania, and Latin America.
       However, 95% of it is cultivated and harvested in West Africa.
       It is a popular side dish served with ewédú and gbẹ̀gìrì (black-eyed beans soup),
       but is also served with a variety of other ọbẹ (soups), such as ẹ̀fọ́, ilá, and or ogbono.</p>
    <p>How to Prepare Amala and Ewedu</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Amala is made from yam peels </li>
        <li>Which have been dried and ground to flour</li>
        <li>Is then boiled in water to make a dough</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Preparing Ewedu:</h3>
    <p>After plucking a fresh jute leaf, rinse and drain water until there is no more sand in them,
        by packing the leaf remnants of sand and particle inside the water.
        You can choose to boil the Ewedu leaf until tender to ease blending.
        You can result to the use of Ijabe, 
        which is a traditional broom used to pound Ewedu until smooth,however a faster and
        more slimy result can be gotten with the use of blender.
        Simply pour the jute leaves into blender, 
        add little water to prevent it from being too watery and blend till smooth.</p>

    <h3>My Fourth best food:</h3>
    <p><b>Jollof Rice</b></p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;background-color: red; color: white;">About Jollof Rice</h3>
    <p>The origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was grown.The dish has its roots in a traditional dish called thieboudienne,
       containing rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables.
        Food and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley,
        but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in:
        "linguistic, historical or political patterns".
        Instead he proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire,
        especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and 
        urban centers, taking with them economic arts of "blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, 
        and rice agronomy" as well as the religion of Islam.</p>
    <h3>How to prepare Jollof Rice</h3>
    <p> parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, pepper, vegetable oil, onions, 
        and stock cubes. Most of the ingredients are cooked in one pot, 
        of which a rich meat stock and a fried tomato and pepper puree
         characteristically forms the base. Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid. 
         The dish is then served with the protein of choice and 
        very often with fried plantains, moi moi, steamed vegetables, coleslaw, salad,</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash your rice thoroughly and parboil it.</li>
        <li>Fry your tomatoes,pepper,onions and seasonings in moderate vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Add your meat stock, rice, and fried pepper to cook, with moderate water.</li>
        <li>Then you can serve with plaintains, moi moi, meat, salad, or anything of your choice.</li>
